# TensorFlow Introduction

This is a codelab material designed as an easy TensorFlow introduction for non ML experts. All you need to know is how to use Python. It would take about 2 - 3 hours to go through all the sections.

- [Preparation](0.%20Preparation.ipynb#): setting up the codelab environment with Cloud Datalab (Jupyter Notebook on GCP)
- [Understanding neural network with TensorFlow Playgroud](1.%20Understanding%20neural%20network%20with%20TensorFlow%20Playground.ipynb): See how "neuron" works with Playground demo
- [Classify Manhattan with TensorFlow](2.%20Classify%20Manhattan%20with%20TensorFlow.ipynb): Let's use TensorFlow to train the most basic neural network
- [Why deep neural network can get smarter?](3.%20Why%20deep%20neural%20network%20can%20get%20smarter%3F.ipynb): Why neural network can get smarter? Build your own deep neural network with Playground and see how it works.
- [Classify MNIST images with TensorFlow](4.%20Classify%20MNIST%20images%20with%20TensorFlow.ipynb): Use TensorFlow to train a  neural network to clasisfy handwritten text images.

Please get started from the [Preparation doc](0.%20Preparation.ipynb#).
